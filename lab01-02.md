# Detailed *dynamic* analysis of Chapter 1L, PE Lab01-02.exe
## Note: all the decompilation was made by myself, if there's any error please do not hesitate in telling me
### Software used: Cutter, IDA, x32dbg

We need to unpack it as it's packed with UPX.
After unpacking, we can see that the malware first connects to the control dispatcher, and tries to open the mutex "HGL345". If failed to open the mutex "HGL345", it will:

- Create a mutex called "HGL345" - `CreateMutexA(NULL,NULL,"HGL345")`
- Open a handle to the service control manager - `scmanager = OpenSCManagerA(0,0,3)`
- Retrieve the full path of the .exe of the current process using the a variable X with buffer size 0x3E8/1000 TCHARs/CHARs
- Create a service called "Malservice" with display name "Malservice" that autostarts, runs in its own process, ignores any error and continues the startup operation, having the service's executable file path as "C:\Users\user\Desktop\Practical Malware Analysis Labs\BinaryCollection\Chapter_1L\Lab01-02.exe", belongs in no group, has no dependencies, runs under the account LocalSystem  - `CreateServiceA(scmanager,"Malservice","Malservice",2,10,2,0,"C:\Users\user\Desktop\Practical Malware Analysis Labs\BinaryCollection\Chapter_1L\Lab01-02.exe",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)`
- Convert system time to file time - `SystemFileToFileTime($ecx,$eax)`
- Create a waitable timer - `CreateWaitableTimer(0,0,0)`
- Activate the timer created, waiting 12 ? (in 100 nanosecond intervals) - `SetWaitableTimer(hTimer=$esi, lpDueTime=12, lPeriod=0, pfnCompletionRoutine=NULL, lpArgToCompletionRoutine=NULL, fResume=false)`
- Wait for the timer to get in the signaled state or timeout interval  passes - `WaitForSingleObject(hHandle=$esi, dwMilliseconds=0xFFFFFFFF)`

If the function above fails it will: **(20x)**

 - Create thread that will, forever:
  - Initialize WinInet with the User-Agent "Internet Explorer 8.0", resolving all hostnames locally, and with no proxy - `InternetOpenA(lpszAgent="Internet Explorer 8.0", dwAccessType=INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_DIRECT, lpszProxy=NULL, lpszProxyBypass=NULL, dwFlags=NULL)`
  - Connect to "http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com" - `InternetOpenUrlA(hInternet=$esi, lpszUrl="http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com", lpszHeaders=NULL, dwHeadersLength=0, dwFlags=INTERNET_FLAG_RELOAD, dwContext=0)`



# Summarized analysis
 - Malware checks for HGL345 mutex, if there's no mutex it will:
  - Create the mutex
  - Create a service called "Malservice" and make it autostart
  - Try getting persistance replicating itself on service "Malservice"
  - Wait 0.0012 milliseconds or 1,200 nanoseconds (? this is probably wrong)
 - Try to DoS (i assume) www.malwareanalysisbook.com, creating 20 threads that will forever keep connecting to the website

# Extremely brief explanation
 - Malware will try to implant itself in the system (if not implanted already)
 - Try to DoS www.malwareanalysisbook.com
